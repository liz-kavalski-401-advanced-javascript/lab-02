### Modules
* list-constructor.js
  * using the constructor methods using different type of array methods
* list.js
  * using the class method using different tpye of array methods
* vehicle-class.js
 class gives methods that related to the class.

 Use the `prototype` method to make a method for the constuctor. 

#### Running the app
* `npm test`
  
#### Tests
* To run tests `run npm test`
* The assertions I made was the on the vehicles-constructors and class test passing. 
* The assertions  I need to, or should be made is getting a better coverage on the the list.js as that show that they are passing the test but only about 55%-66%
